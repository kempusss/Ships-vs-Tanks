# Ships-vs-Tanks
This game was created for my C language class project. It's a simple tower defense game. The goal is to survive all waves of incoming enemies. To achieve that player can build, upgrade, inspect and sell towers. The player wins if  at least one live remains after all waves have passed.

## Running the game
To compile the program the CSFML library should be installed.
On Linux it can by installed by typing in the terminal following line:

`sudo apt-get install libcsfml-dev libcsfml-doc`

Then, we can compile the game with the line:

`make game`

To run the game, we just need to type:

`./game`

We can also clean the executable file with the command:`

`make clean`
